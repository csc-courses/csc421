## Project 4: Fat Skeleton Project

File systems are an example of data persistence. Computer operating systems make the file system one of their core provisions to the user. 
Modern operating systems allow for a variety of file systems to be in use at the same time.

A very popular file system is FAT. It was Microsoft's original file system, even before windows, and continues to this day in many devices.

We are implementing a very simplified FAT that is just the skeletal data structure of FAT, hence the name. A skeleton is not fat.
